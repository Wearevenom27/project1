										<h2>Business V.S. Cyber Techs</h2>
										<p>The Needs V.S. What Is Needed</p>
									</header>
									<p>As I am learning in this course we came upon a subject concerning what the company as a whole can afford versus what is actually needed for the cyber techs to properly secure a companies servers. I can understand both sides. It's not only the funds that can be a problem for a company but also the hassle of having too many moving parts or making it too advanced for the company to use properly. In practice both the company and cyber techs should have to come together to come with a solution of understanding what is needed and how it can be funded.</p>

									<h3>Fitting The Proper Shape That Fits</h3>
									<p>In any field security can be very confusing or complex for anyone. A company can have a specific need but won't have the funds to carry out those needs. This is where a company should take its time to find they right cyber tech for their needs. A cyber tech who will specialize in that certain company. They will help the company choose the best practices for their individual needs. They will make sure you have exactly what the company requires to be not only safe but also functional. </p>

									<h3>The Reality Of It All</h3>
									<p>In a perfect world that would be the perfect balance between the two sides. The truth of the matter is the company will hire the cyber tech for a specific job, and they will have limited funds. The cyber tech will have to try their best to provide a secure program with the funds associated for their services. This is where the balancing act begins the cyber tech will have to know where he can "cut corners" or "trim the fat" to fit what the company needs.Even if the cyber tech has an unlimited there could be a chance that the cyber tech would make the program or the whole security program too complicated for the company to use properly. It can even have issues for their clients or their employees. </p>

										<li>Providing feedback on the potential difficulty levels of various tasks, drawing from our classroom learnings.</li>
										<li>Helping to fine-tune the balance between challenge and accessibility.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>CTF-03: The Challenge That Tested Limits</h3>
									<p>As the challenge unfolded, all eyes were on CTF-03, a level that was deemed nearly impossible to crack manually due to its complexity. The buzz among participants was electric, with theories and strategies flying around.</p>

									<h3>The Unnamed Hero</h3>
									<p>Then emerged an unnamed hero, a brave soul who vowed to conquer CTF-03 manually, refusing to take the scripting route that others deemed necessary. The air was thick with anticipation as we all watched, hearts in our mouths, wondering if the impossible could indeed become possible.</p>

									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>As I pen down this chapter of Shukur's Cyber Chronicles, the CTF event remains the talk of the town, with tales of the unnamed hero becoming a legend in the corridors of LwJ. Will the unnamed hero conquer the insurmountable CTF-03? Only time will tell, as the halls of Learning with Jane echo with whispers of strategies, scripts, and the undying spirit of challenge.</p>
									<p>Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling journey, where perseverance meets intelligence, and where every click could lead to victory or despair. Until next time, keep challenging, keep learning!</p>
