										<h2>Business V.S. Cyber Techs</h2>
										<p>The Needs V.S. What Is Needed</p>
									</header>
									<p>As I am learning in this course we came upon a subject concerning what the company as a whole can afford versus what is actually needed for the cyber techs to properly secure a companies servers. I can understand both sides. It's not only the funds that can be a problem for a company but also the hassle of having too many moving parts or making it too advanced for the company to use properly. In practice both the company and cyber techs should have to come together to come with a solution of understanding what is needed and how it can be funded.</p>

									<h3>Fitting The Proper Shape That Fits</h3>
									<p>In any field security can be very confusing or complex for anyone. A company can have a specific need but won't have the funds to carry out those needs. This is where a company should take its time to find they right cyber tech for their needs. A cyber tech who will specialize in that certain company. They will help the company choose the best practices for their individual needs. They will make sure you have exactly what the company requires to be not only safe but also functional. </p>

									<h3>The Reality Of It All</h3>
									<p>In a perfect world that would be the perfect balance between the two sides. The truth of the matter is the company will hire the cyber tech for a specific job, and they will have limited funds. The cyber tech will have to try their best to provide a secure program with the funds associated for their services. This is where the balancing act begins the cyber tech will have to know where he can "cut corners" or "trim the fat" to fit what the company needs.Even if the cyber tech has an unlimited there could be a chance that the cyber tech would make the program or the whole security program too complicated for the company to use properly. It can even have issues for their clients or their employees. </p>




									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>In the end as stated earlier there has to be a perfect balance between the two side. Meetings must be held between both parties. Compromises must be made as well on both sides. The cyber tech must show the company how these funds are being used and if the programs meet the companies needs. This si why it is highly important for a cyber tech to know the their craft very well and know how to "skin a cat" more than one way, they have to know and think like a cyber criminal in order to protect as much  as they can. </p>
