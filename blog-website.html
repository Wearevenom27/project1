										<h2>Daniel's Cyber Journey</h2>
										<p>My Way Into The Cyber Security World</p>
									</header>
									<p>This will be an inside look at what it takes for me to try and change my career at the age of 37.</p>

									<h3>I have been a technician for over 12 years. I have installed Direct TV, Dish Network and ADT security systems. I do enjoy working with my hands and solving customer's problems. My day to day is always different. Every house is different and every system needs its own way of being installed. Now that I am 37 years old I quickly came to a realization that my physical body won't last. I was warned by my elders about this, but I had to go through it to really believe in what they were saying.</h3>
									<p>Begin your journey with the initial setup of your Ubuntu 22.04 VPS on the reputable Hetzner Cloud platform. Hetzner offers an intuitive setup guide to get your server operational in no time.</p>

									<h3>Step 2: Hardening Your VPS</h3>
									<p>Security is paramount, hence the need to harden your VPS. The following steps are crucial:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Updating your server to patch any vulnerabilities.</li>
										<li>Installing fail2ban to shield against brute force attacks.</li>
										<li>Enforcing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for heightened security.</li>
										<li>Disabling both password and root login to avert unauthorized access.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Step 3: Configuring Hetzner Firewall</h3>
									<p>Take your server security a notch higher by configuring the Hetzner Firewall to permit access exclusively from your IP address, thereby protecting your server throughout the project.</p>

									<h3>Step 4: Installing LEMP Stack</h3>
									<p>Next on the agenda is installing the LEMP stack which is a potent combo of Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP. This setup is pivotal in laying a solid foundation for your upcoming WordPress site.</p>

									<h3>Step 5: Setting Up WordPress</h3>
									<p>With the LEMP stack ready, it's time to install WordPress. During the installation:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Configure the necessary security settings to guard against potential threats.</li>
										<li>Set up basic settings to start on a sound footing.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Step 6: Domain Registration with Google Domains</h3>
									<p>Secure a domain name with Google Domains, and ensure to create the base and 'www' A records directing to your Hetzner VPS.</p>

									<h3>Step 7: Configuring Nginx with Certbot/Letsencrypt</h3>
									<p>Before delving into SSL certification with Certbot/Letsencrypt:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Adjust your firewall rules to allow HTTP/S traffic.</li>
										<li>Configure Nginx accurately to facilitate a smooth certification process.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3>Step 8: Finding and Installing a WordPress vCard Theme</h3>
									<p>Give your WordPress site a professional touch by selecting and installing a vCard theme from ThemeForest.</p>

									<h3>Step 9: Enhancing Security with WP Plugins</h3>
									<p>As a final step, bolster your site's defense mechanism by incorporating free, yet effective, security plugins available for WordPress.</p>

									<h3>Conclusion</h3>
									<p>Following this detailed guide ensures a secure, functional, and visually appealing website hosted on an Ubuntu 22.04 VPS in the Hetzner Cloud. Remember, the key to a secure system is regular updates; therefore, keep your system and plugins up-to-date to enjoy a secure and fluid user experience.</p>
