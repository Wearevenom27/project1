										<h2>Daniel's Cyber Journey</h2>
										<p>My Way Into The Cyber Security World</p>
									</header>
									<p>This will be an inside look at what it takes for me to try and change my career at the age of 37.</p>

									<h3>Where I am in my life</h3>
									<p>I have been a technician for over 12 years. I have installed Direct TV, Dish Network and ADT security systems. I do enjoy working with my hands and solving customer's problems. My day to day is always different. Every house is different and every system needs its own way of being installed. Now that I am 37 years old I quickly came to a realization that my physical body won't last. I was warned by my elders about this, but I had to go through it to really believe in what they were saying.</p>

									<h3>My wake-up call into cybersecurity.</h3>
									<p>A few months ago I got my wake u call that I needed a new career. I was doing a job on a Tuesday, nothing out of the ordinary, but then as I was running cable in the customer's garage the customer decided to open his garage door as my arm was in the track of the door. The garage door started to crush my arm, as the customer started to panic, the door kept trying to open regardless of my arm being in the way. I was lucky tht an electrician was there with me and he quickly dropped the door manually. I got hurt in the job. I only got paid 60 percent of my wage. I have a family to provide for and that was not enough to pay the bills.</p>




									<h3>A Friend Who Showed Me The Way</h3>
									<p>As I was struggling to pay my bills and getting written up at work I had a friend who actually called me out of the blue to see how I was doing. He is cybersecurity and we have been on the same jobs in the past. He explained how it works and how excited he is to be in this role.He taught himself how to do it, it took him about two years to do and I needed to quickly get myself in it as my company did not care too much that I got hurt while working for them. I wanted a new career one where I can do from home and that is challenging. Cybersecurity seemed to be the answer for me. I was afraid in the past to move into a new career, but a new fear resonated within me. If I get hurt at work where I can no longer work, who is going to support my family? I couldn't wait any longer I needed to move onto a new career path one that is safer for me. </p>

									<h3>My Journey So Far</h3>

									</ul>
